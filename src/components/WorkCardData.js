The plugin features three unique items: a Super Pickaxe that mines in a 3x3 area for efficient resource gathering, Flash Boots that grant extraordinary speed and jump height, and a Winged Helmet that enables creative-mode flight. This project showcases my proficiency in Java development, event-driven programming, command implementation, and scheduled task management within the Minecraft ecosystem, all built using IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle for seamless compilation and deployment.",
